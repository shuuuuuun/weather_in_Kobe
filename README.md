# Weather in Kobe – Exploratory & Predictive Analytics
A hands‑on Python + PySpark project built with an open Kaggle dataset

1. Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a full data‑analytics workflow using daily weather observations from Kobe, Japan.
You will walk through – and be able to reproduce – the journey from raw CSV files to:

  1.Clean & EDA – quick data‑quality profile and visual summary

  2.Seasonality Analysis – monthly temperature / precipitation cycles

  3.Extreme‑Weather Detection – hottest, wettest, and record‑breaking days

  4.Long‑term Trend Lines – year‑on‑year climate shifts since 1990s

  5.Next‑Day Weather Models – logistic & regression baselines in Spark ML

  6.Lifestyle Recommender – rule‑based “Laundry‑Day / Hiking‑Day” index

The code is intentionally split into a pandas‑only path (for laptops) and an Apache Spark path (for larger‑scale or cloud notebooks such as Databricks Community Edition).
